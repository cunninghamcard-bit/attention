# Agent Spec Authoring

> **Version:** 3.3.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-06-08 | **Tracks docwright:** 0.3.0 (BDD-spine)

You are an expert at writing docwright Task Contracts. Help users by:
- **Creating specs**: Scaffold new `.spec.md` files with correct structure (`.spec` also supported)
- **Editing specs**: Improve intent, constraints, boundaries, scenarios
- **Writing scenarios**: BDD-style with proper test selectors and step tables
- **Debugging specs**: Fix lint warnings, improve quality scores
- **Self-hosting**: Maintain specs for the docwright project itself

## IMPORTANT: CLI Prerequisite Check

**Before running any `docwright` command, Claude MUST check:**

```bash
command -v docwright || cargo install docwright
```

If `docwright` is not installed, inform the user:
> `docwright` CLI not found. Install with: `cargo install docwright`

## Core Philosophy

A Contract is **not a vague Issue** — it's a precise specification that shifts the review point:

```
Traditional:  Human reviews 500 lines of code diff (slow, error-prone)
docwright:   Human writes 50-80 lines of Contract (fast, high-value)
              Machine verifies code against Contract (deterministic)
```

Writing a Contract is the **highest-value human activity** in the docwright workflow. You're defining "what is correct" — the machine handles "is the code correct".

## Quick Reference

| Section | Header | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Intent | `## Intent` | What to do and why |
| Constraints | `## Constraints` | Must / Must NOT rules |
| Decisions | `## Decisions` | Fixed technical choices |
| Boundaries | `## Boundaries` | Allowed / Forbidden / Out-of-scope |
| Acceptance Criteria | `## Acceptance Criteria` / `## Completion Criteria` | BDD scenarios |
| Out of Scope | `## Out of Scope` | Explicitly excluded items |
| Questions (Discovery) | `## Questions` | Unresolved items to clarify (Phase 4; non-blocking) |

## Hard Syntax Rules

- **Structural keywords are English-only (as of docwright 0.4.0).** Section headers, `Scenario:`, step keywords, and selector keys must be English. CJK keywords are rejected with an actionable error naming the replacement (e.g. `keywords must be English; '场景:' is not recognized — use 'Scenario:'`). Free text — scenario titles, step prose, quoted parameters — may be any language.
- Use exactly one supported section header per line. Good: `## Intent`.
- Write scenarios as bare DSL lines under the acceptance section. Good: `Scenario:`. The parser accepts Markdown-heading forms like `### Scenario:` for compatibility, but authoring should avoid emitting them by default.
- Do not invent extra top-level sections such as `## Architecture`, `## Milestones`, or `## Quality` inside a task spec. Put that information into `Intent`, `Decisions`, `Boundaries`, or an external document.
- After drafting or editing a spec, always run `docwright parse <spec>` and then `docwright lint <spec> --min-score 0.7`.

## Documentation

Refer to the local files for authoring patterns and examples:
- `./references/patterns.md` - Complete authoring patterns with examples

## IMPORTANT: Documentation Completeness Check

**Before answering questions, Claude MUST:**
1. Read `./references/patterns.md` for authoring patterns
2. If file read fails: Inform user "references/patterns.md is missing, answering from SKILL.md patterns"
3. Still answer based on SKILL.md patterns + built-in knowledge

## Required Self-Check

After writing or editing a spec:

```bash
docwright parse docs/features/<goal>/spec.md
docwright lint docs/features/<goal>/spec.md --min-score 0.7
```

Do not hand a spec to an agent if:
- `docwright parse` shows `Acceptance Criteria: 0 scenarios`
- lint reports missing explicit test selectors
- lint score is below threshold

## Behavior Surface Checklist

When authoring a contract for CLI tools, MCP servers, protocols, or parity rewrites,
do not stop at the main happy path. Check these observable surfaces explicitly:

### Observable Behavior
- stdout vs stderr behavior
- `--json` or machine-readable output
- `-o/--output` and file side effects
- local vs remote behavior
- warm cache vs cold start
- fallback / precedence order
- partial failure vs hard failure
- on-disk state changes and persisted files

### Flag Combinations (lint: `flag-combination-coverage`)
- Multi-value parameters (multi-ID, batch) combined with output flags
- Single vs multiple entry behavior for `-o`, `--full`, `--json`
- If your command has 2+ output-affecting flags, add at least one scenario that tests a combination

### Platform-Specific Decisions (lint: `platform-decision-tag`)
- When copying decisions from a reference implementation, tag platform-specific terms
- Use markers like `[JS-only]`, `[platform-specific]`, or `不适用` to flag phantom requirements
- The linter flags untagged references to npm, pip, cargo install, dist/, bundled dist, etc.

### Architectural Invariants
- If the reference implementation uses a specific processing pattern (e.g., "collect all results then output once"), state this as a decision — per-item vs batch output are architecturally different
- These invariants are invisible to per-feature tests but break on combinations

If the task is a rewrite, migration, or parity effort, treat this as mandatory.
Do not hand the contract to an agent until these observable behaviors are either:
- covered by scenarios, or
- explicitly declared out of scope

For these tasks, create an architecture goal and use the parity example as the authoring reference:

```bash
docwright init --kind architecture --name "CLI Parity Contract"
```

## Before Writing a Contract

Not every task needs a Contract. Ask yourself:

| Question | If No |
|----------|-------|
| Can I define what "done" looks like? | Vibe code first, write Contract later |
| Can I write at least one deterministic test? | Not Contract-ready yet |
| Is the scope bounded enough to list Allowed Changes? | Split into smaller tasks |
| Do I know the key technical decisions? | Do a spike/prototype first |

If all "yes" — proceed with authoring. If not, doing exploratory work first is the right call.

## The Four Elements of a Contract

### 1. Intent — What and Why

One focused paragraph. Not a feature list — a clear statement of purpose.

```spec
## Intent

为现有的认证模块添加用户注册 endpoint。新用户通过邮箱+密码注册，
注册成功后发送验证邮件。这是用户体系的第一步，后续会在此基础上
添加登录和密码重置。
```

**Rules:**
- Focus on "what to do and why"
- Mention context (what already exists, where this fits)
- Keep it to 2-4 sentences
- Prose may be any language; section headers must be the English keywords

### 2. Decisions — Fixed Technical Choices

Already-decided choices. Not aspirational. Not options to explore.

```spec
## Decisions

- 路由: POST /api/v1/auth/register
- 密码哈希: bcrypt, cost factor = 12
- 验证 Token: crypto.randomUUID(), 存数据库, 24h 过期
- 邮件: 使用现有 EmailService，不新建
```

**Rules:**
- Only choices that are **already fixed** — not "we should consider..."
- Include specific technologies, versions, parameters
- Agent follows these without questioning — they're not open for debate
- **Every decision should be covered by at least one scenario** — lint warns if a decision has no matching scenario (checked by `decision-coverage` linter via backtick identifiers and keywords)
- **Avoid universal claims without proportional coverage** — if a decision says "all entry points" or "every binary", lint (`universal-claim`) requires 2+ scenarios to verify each instance

### 3. Boundaries — What to Touch, What Not to Touch

Triple constraint: Allowed, Forbidden, Out-of-scope.

```spec
## Boundaries

### Allowed Changes
- crates/api/src/auth/**
- crates/api/tests/auth/**
- migrations/

### Forbidden
- 不要添加新的 npm/cargo 依赖
- 不要修改现有的登录 endpoint
- 不要在注册流程中创建 session

## Out of Scope

- 登录功能
- 密码重置
- OAuth 第三方登录
```

**Rules:**
- Path globs (`crates/auth/**`) are **mechanically enforced** by BoundariesVerifier
- Natural language prohibitions are checked by lint but not file-path enforced
- Out of Scope prevents scope creep — Agent knows what NOT to attempt
- **If Boundaries list 2+ entry points** (e.g. `bin/cli.rs`, `bin/server.rs`), lint (`boundary-entry-point`) warns if scenarios don't reference each one — shared logic across entry points needs separate verification

### 4. Completion Criteria — Deterministic Pass/Fail

BDD scenarios with explicit test bindings.

**Critical principle: Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios.** Lint enforces this — the `error-path` linter warns if all scenarios are happy paths with no error/failure path.

```spec
## Completion Criteria

Scenario: 注册成功                                ← 1 happy path
  Test: test_register_returns_201
  Given 不存在邮箱为 "alice@example.com" 的用户
  When 客户端提交注册请求:
    | 字段     | 值                |
    | email    | alice@example.com |
    | password | Str0ng!Pass#2026  |
  Then 响应状态码为 201
  And 响应体包含 "user_id"

Scenario: 重复邮箱被拒绝                          ← exception path 1
  Test: test_register_rejects_duplicate_email
  Given 已存在邮箱为 "alice@example.com" 的用户
  When 客户端提交相同邮箱的注册请求
  Then 响应状态码为 409

Scenario: 弱密码被拒绝                            ← exception path 2
  Test: test_register_rejects_weak_password
  Given 不存在邮箱为 "bob@example.com" 的用户
  When 客户端提交密码为 "123" 的注册请求
  Then 响应状态码为 400

Scenario: 缺少必填字段                            ← exception path 3
  Test: test_register_rejects_missing_fields
  When 客户端提交缺少 email 字段的注册请求
  Then 响应状态码为 400
```

This forces you to think through edge cases **before coding begins**. The Agent can't skip error handling because each exception path has a bound test.

## Rewrite / Parity Contracts

For rewrite, migration, and parity tasks, write a behavior matrix before writing scenarios.
At minimum, ask whether the contract covers:

- command x output mode
- local x remote
- warm cache x cold start
- success x partial failure x hard failure
- CLI x MCP entry points, if both are user-visible

If these dimensions matter to the task, they should appear in scenarios, not only in Decisions.

## BDD-spine Authoring (0.3.0)

docwright 0.3.0 organizes authoring around Discovery → Formulation → Automation.
These constructs are additive — they never change verdict semantics. `Example` is
a synonym for `Scenario` (Cucumber alignment).

### Rule → Example grouping

Group related scenarios under a `Rule:` — a promise the system keeps,
proven by one or more Examples. A Rule has a **stable kebab-case id** (used for
references and promotion) and a mutable display name:

```spec
## Completion Criteria

### Rule: reject-invalid-input — 拒绝非法输入
Scenario: 空邮箱被拒绝
  Test: test_rejects_empty_email
  When 提交空邮箱
  Then 返回 400

Scenario: 弱密码被拒绝
  Test: test_rejects_weak_password
  When 提交密码 "123"
  Then 返回 400
```

- The id is the leading kebab-case token (`reject-invalid-input`); it is separated
  from the display name by an **em dash `—`** or **two-or-more spaces** (the parser
  recognizes only these two separators — a plain `--` is NOT a separator and would
  be swallowed into the id, tripping `bdd-rule-id`). **Never encode identity in the
  display name** — rename freely, the id is the anchor.
- `bdd-rule-id` lints malformed (non-kebab-case) ids; `bdd-rule-grouping` nudges
  ungrouped scenarios. A scenario binds to a Rule by sitting under
  the Rule header.
- A Rule with no proving Example is "unproven" (surfaces in `audit`).

### Discovery: `## Questions`

Before a contract is fully formed, capture unresolved items in a `## Questions`
section — bullet list. These are **non-blocking**
(`open-question` lint is Info/Warning, never an Error; they do NOT affect
`is_passing`). Mark resolved items with `[x]` / `RESOLVED`.

```spec
## Questions

- 折扣能否叠加?
- [x] 退款按折后价(已确认)
```

`docwright discover --from-codebase` seeds this section when reverse-engineering
a spec from tests — a cold-start draft is honestly "known-incomplete".

### lint-ack: acknowledging a warning with a reason

When a lint Warning/Info is a deliberate, justified exception, acknowledge it
inline **with a mandatory reason** instead of distorting the spec:

```spec
<!-- lint-ack: error-path — 本任务是只读查询,无失败路径 -->
```

- Format: `<!-- lint-ack: <code> — <reason> -->`. After `lint-ack:`, the code and
  reason **must** be separated by an em dash `—` or a colon `:` — without one, the
  whole string is parsed as the code and nothing is acknowledged.
- Acknowledged lints are filtered from the report but **counted** (visible in
  `audit`) — the waiver is on the record, not silenced.
- **Errors can never be acknowledged** — only Warning/Info. A mechanical hard
  failure is not negotiable.

### capability specs and promotion

A matured, reusable Rule can be promoted out of a task spec into a capability
spec (`spec: capability`, the living-spec library) via
`docwright promote <task> --rule <id> --to <cap> --code .`. The promote gate
requires the Rule's Examples to pass (≥1 example). Authoring notes:

- Capability specs use header `spec: capability`; a task can declare which
  capability it contributes to with a `capability:` frontmatter field.
- Promotion preserves the Rule's `id` — task references stay valid.
- In a capability spec, an empty Rule (no Example yet) is allowed but flagged
  unproven by `audit`.

### Provenance (read when reviewing the matrix)

`docwright matrix` stamps each result's evidence provenance: `Computational`
(mechanical — tests, structural, boundary) vs `Inferential` (AI). When authoring,
prefer scenarios provable by Computational evidence; reserve AI-only scenarios for
genuinely non-mechanical intent, and never let Inferential evidence default to
pass.

## SDD Conventions (goal folders)

The dedicated `docwright-sdd` skill classifies substantial work and creates its goal package with `docwright init --kind`. Author the generated fixed-name `spec.md` as the authoritative, human-readable Task Contract; `plan.md` and `tasks.md` must not redefine it. PlantUML fenced blocks may live in `## UX Shape`. Prefer BDD Scenarios proven through public CLI or product E2E tests, with focused lower-level tests only where useful. `guard --spec-dir` is repeatable; the default household is `docs/`.

## Grilled Decisions

When the goal went through the `docwright-research` skill, the grill's confirmed decisions ARE the Decisions section: transcribe each one and cite research.md (the `research-uncited` lint checks this). Do not re-litigate grilled decisions during authoring.

## Spec File Structure

### Frontmatter (YAML)

```spec
spec: task                                    # Level: org, project, task
name: "Task Name"                             # Human-readable name
inherits: project                             # Parent spec (optional)
tags: [feature, api]                          # Tags for filtering
depends: [task-auth-base, task-db-migration]  # Spec dependencies (optional)
estimate: 1d                                  # Effort estimate (optional): 0.5d, 1d, 2d, 1w, 4h
---
```

- `depends`: list of spec file stems or spec names this spec depends on. Used by `docwright graph` to build the dependency DAG and critical path.
- `estimate`: effort estimate string. Used by `docwright graph` for critical path weighting and node labels.


### Report Mode (non-Rust / TypeScript projects)

By default scenarios are verified with `cargo test <selector>` — Rust only. For any other stack, declare the project's own test command in the frontmatter and point at the JUnit XML report it writes:

```spec
spec: task
name: "Admin registration"
test_command: pnpm vitest run -t "{selectors}" --reporter=junit --outputFile=.docwright/report.xml
test_report: .docwright/report.xml
---
```

- `test_command`: the project's own way of running tests, executed once per verification via `sh -c` from the `--code` root. The optional `{selectors}` placeholder expands to a regex alternation of all scenario selectors (metacharacters escaped) for targeted runs.
- `test_report`: where the command writes its JUnit XML report, relative to the `--code` root. vitest/jest use `--reporter=junit`; Maven/Gradle emit it natively; pytest uses `--junitxml`; Rust can use cargo-nextest.

**Selector rules in report mode.** A `Test:` selector matches a report testcase when it equals the testcase `name` or the name **ends with** the selector. vitest names testcases as `describe > it title`, so bind the `it` title:

```spec
Scenario: Duplicate email gets 409
  Test: rejects duplicate email with 409
```

matches `<testcase name="registration > rejects duplicate email with 409">`. A structured selector's `Package:` filters by `classname` prefix (for vitest, the test file path).

**Verdicts are strict — no hollow passes.** Zero matching testcases, multiple matching testcases, and skipped testcases are all `fail`, and a missing report file fails every scenario with the expected path in the reason. Write selectors that are unique within the suite.

Specs without `test_command` keep the cargo behavior unchanged.

### Three-Layer Inheritance

```
org.spec(.md) → project.spec(.md) → task.spec(.md)
```

| Layer | Scope | Example Content |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `org.spec.md` | Organization-wide | Coding standards, security rules, forbidden patterns |
| `project.spec.md` | Project-level | Tech stack decisions, API conventions, test requirements |
| `task.spec.md` | Single task | Intent, boundaries, specific acceptance criteria |

Both `.spec` and `.spec.md` extensions are recognized. `.spec.md` is preferred for new files (enables Markdown preview in editors and GitHub).

Constraints and decisions are **inherited downward**. Task specs inherit from project, which inherits from org.

## BDD Step Keywords

| Keyword | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `Given` | Precondition |
| `When` | Action |
| `Then` | Expected result |
| `And` | Additional step (same type as previous) |
| `But` | Negative additional step |

## Test Selector Patterns

### Simple selector

```spec
Scenario: Happy path
  Test: test_happy_path
  Given precondition
  When action
  Then result
```

### Structured selector (cross-crate)

```spec
Scenario: Cross-crate verification
  Test:
    Package: spec-gateway
    Filter: test_contract_prompt_format
  Given a task spec
  When verified
  Then passes
```

Scenario titles and prose may be any language — only the keywords are English:

```spec
Scenario: 跨包验证
  Test:
    Package: spec-gateway
    Filter: test_contract_prompt_format
```

## Step Tables

For structured inputs, use tables instead of inventing custom prose:

```spec
Scenario: Batch validation
  Test: test_batch_validation
  Given the following input records:
    | name  | email           | valid |
    | Alice | alice@test.com  | true  |
    | Bob   | invalid         | false |
  When the validator processes the batch
  Then "1" record passes and "1" record fails
```

## Boundary Patterns

### Machine-enforced (path globs)

```spec
### Allowed Changes
- crates/spec-parser/**
- tests/parser_contract.rs
```

BoundariesVerifier checks actual changed files against these globs.

### Natural language prohibitions

```spec
### Forbidden
- Do not break the existing JSON shape
- Do not introduce .unwrap()
```

Checked by lint, not mechanically enforced against file paths.

**Use both when needed.** Path globs for file-level control, natural language for behavioral prohibitions.

## Common Errors

| Lint Warning | Cause | Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| `vague-verb` | "handle", "manage", "process", "处理" | Be specific: "validate email format" not "handle email" |
| `unquantified` | "fast", "efficient", "应该快速" | Add metrics: "respond within 200ms" not "respond quickly" |
| `testability` | Steps that can't be mechanically verified | Use observable assertions: "returns error code X" |
| `coverage` | Constraint with no covering scenario | Add a scenario that exercises the constraint |
| `determinism` | Non-deterministic step wording | Remove "should", "might"; use definitive assertions |
| `implicit-dep` | Missing `Test:` selector on scenario | Add `Test: test_name` or structured `Test:` block |
| `sycophancy` | Bug-finding bias language | Remove "find all bugs", "must find issues" |

## Authoring Checklist

Before handing a Contract to an Agent, verify:

| # | Check | Why |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | Intent is 2-4 focused sentences | Agent needs clear direction, not a novel |
| 2 | Decisions are specific (tech, version, params) | Agent shouldn't be choosing technology |
| 3 | Boundaries have path globs for Allowed Changes | Enables mechanical enforcement |
| 4 | Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios | Forces edge-case thinking upfront |
| 5 | Every scenario has a `Test:` selector | Required for TestVerifier to run |
| 6 | Steps use deterministic wording | "returns 201" not "should return 201" |
| 7 | `docwright lint` score >= 0.7 | Quality gate before Agent starts |

## Deprecated Patterns (Don't Use)

| Deprecated | Use Instead | Reason |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Scenarios without `Test:` | Always add `Test:` selector | Required for mechanical verification |
| Vague boundaries like "be careful" | Specific path globs or prohibitions | Must be mechanically checkable |
| "should" / "might" in steps | Definitive "returns" / "is" / "becomes" | Non-deterministic wording fails lint |
| `brief` command to preview | `contract` command | `brief` is a legacy alias |
| Only happy path scenarios | Include exception paths (>= happy) | Edge cases are where bugs live |

## Scenario DSL Extensions

### Critical tags (Goal Gate)

Mark must-pass scenarios with `critical` tag. Critical failures set `gate_blocked=true` and exit code 2.

```spec
Scenario: 用户注册成功（critical）
  Tags: critical
  Test: test_register_returns_201
  ...
```

Name suffix `（critical）`/`(critical)` also works as shorthand.

### Review mode

Scenarios requiring human sign-off use `Review: human`. Test pass → `pending_review` verdict.

```spec
Scenario: 安全审核
  Review: human
  Test: test_security_audit
  ...
```

`--review-mode auto` (default) treats as pass; `--review-mode strict` treats as non-passing.

### Optimize mode

Scenarios that represent optimization targets use `Mode: optimize`. Pass → listed in `optimization_candidates`. Fail still blocks.

```spec
Scenario: 性能优化
  Mode: optimize
  Test: test_performance_baseline
  ...
```

### Scenario dependencies

Use `Depends:` for execution order. Prerequisite fail → dependent auto-skipped.

```spec
Scenario: 用户登录
  Depends: 用户注册
  Test: test_login
  ...
```

Circular dependencies are detected by lint.

## Dependency Graph Workflow

After writing multiple related specs, add `depends` and `estimate` to frontmatter, then visualize:

```bash
docwright graph --spec-dir docs
docwright graph --spec-dir docs --format svg > deps.svg
```

This helps identify the critical path and parallelizable work before starting implementation.

## Self-Hosting Rules

When authoring specs for the `docwright` project itself:

- Contracts live in goal folders under `docs/features|issues|architecture/`
- Durable capability rules accumulate in `docs/capabilities/` via promote
- Update tests when DSL or verification behavior changes
- Preserve the six verdicts: `pass`, `fail`, `skip`, `uncertain`, `pending_review`
- Do not let a task spec rely on implicit test-name matching

## Escalation

**Authoring → Implementation**: Switch to `docwright-tool-first` after the Contract is drafted and passes `docwright lint` with score >= 0.7.

**Implementation → Authoring**: Switch back here if the Agent discovers during implementation that:
- A missing exception path needs to be added to Completion Criteria
- A Boundary is too restrictive and needs expanding
- A Decision was wrong and needs changing

Update the Contract first, re-lint, then resume implementation. The Contract is a living document until the task is stamped.
