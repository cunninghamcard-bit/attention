name: "Pi Tool Execution Event Protocol"
inherits: project

## Intent

Complete Attention's tool-execution lifecycle protocol so
`tool_execution_update` and `tool_execution_end` are delivered to kernel hooks
before they are published to RPC and TUI subscribers. Hook handlers may
mutate the same event object, matching Pi's event-first model without adding a
separate patch-result protocol. This is a core Pi-compatible runtime contract
and is not plugin-specific.

## Decisions

- Keep `tool_execution_update` and `tool_execution_end` as plain hook events whose handler return values are ignored.
- Emit `ToolExecutionUpdateEvent` and `ToolExecutionEndEvent` as mutable event pointers from the harness bridge.
- Each handler receives the same event object after earlier handlers have applied field mutations.
- Handler errors are reported and dispatch continues to later handlers.
- The orchestrator mode publisher runs after shell hooks and native/user extension handlers so subscribers receive the final mutated event.
- Shell hooks remain notification-only for these lifecycle events and do not parse stdout as a JSON patch.
- `hook.Registry.Emit` remains generic and does not hardcode tool execution patch semantics.
- `tool_execution_start` remains notification-only.
- Do not add a second event bus.

## Boundaries

### Allowed Changes

- internal/hook/**
- internal/harness/**
- internal/agentloop/**
- internal/orchestrator/**
- internal/mode/rpc/**

### Forbidden

- Do not add plugin-specific files or behavior.
- Do not change slash-command execution.
- Do not add patch-result types for tool execution lifecycle events.
- Do not make unrelated notification events mutable.
- Do not special-case the TUI.

### Out of Scope

- RPC slash-command dispatch.
- File plugin system.
- Interactive settings UI.

## Completion Criteria

Scenario: update mutation is published to subscribers
Test: TestCompletionCriteriaToolExecutionUpdateMutationPublishesFinalEvent
Given a `tool_execution_update` handler mutates the event partial result
When a tool emits a streaming partial result
Then orchestrator subscribers receive the mutated partial result
And RPC serialization uses the mutated partial result

Scenario: end mutation is published to subscribers
Test: TestCompletionCriteriaToolExecutionEndMutationPublishesFinalEvent
Given a `tool_execution_end` handler mutates the final result and error flag
When a tool execution finishes
Then orchestrator subscribers receive the mutated result
And RPC serialization uses the mutated `isError` value

Scenario: multiple mutation handlers compose in order
Test: TestCompletionCriteriaToolExecutionMutationHandlersComposeAndErrorsDoNotBlockPublish
Given two `tool_execution_update` handlers mutate the same event object
When the hook registry emits the update event
Then the second handler observes the first handler's mutation
And subscribers receive the second handler's final mutation

Scenario: handler error does not block later mutation or publish
Test: TestCompletionCriteriaToolExecutionMutationHandlersComposeAndErrorsDoNotBlockPublish
Given the first tool execution handler returns an error
And a later handler applies a valid mutation
When the hook registry emits the event
Then the error is reported
And subscribers still receive the later mutated event

Scenario: publisher runs after hook handlers
Test: TestCompletionCriteriaToolExecutionPublisherRunsAfterNativeHandlers
Given a hook handler mutates tool execution update and end events
When the orchestrator publishes those lifecycle events
Then subscribers receive the final mutated event state
And no TUI-specific branch is required

Scenario: start event remains notification-only
Test: TestEventSinkToolExecutionUpdateEndUseMutableEvents
Given `tool_execution_start` is emitted as a value event
When a tool execution starts
Then the start event is still published unchanged
And update and end events are the only mutable tool execution lifecycle events
